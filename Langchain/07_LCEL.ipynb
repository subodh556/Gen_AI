This was in the 1960s, when Modi was just a teenager.\\n\\nIn fact, Modi has often spoken about how this experience taught him valuable lessons about hard work, entrepreneurship, and interacting with people from all walks of life. He has even referred to himself as a \"chaiwala\" (tea seller) on several occasions, proudly embracing his humble beginnings.\\n\\nWho would have thought that the boy who sold tea at a railway station would one day become the Prime Minister of India?'"

When he was 11 years old, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, which meant that his body wasn't producing enough growth hormone, a hormone that regulates growth and development. This condition can lead to short stature and other growth-related issues. However, Messi's family couldn't afford the treatment, which cost around $1,500 per month.\\n\\nLuckily, Messi's talent on the pitch caught the attention of FC Barcelona, and the club offered to pay for his treatment in exchange for him joining their youth academy. Messi's family accepted the offer, and he began his treatment, which lasted for several years. Despite this challenge, Messi went on to become one of the greatest soccer players of all time, known for his incredible speed, agility, and ball control.\"}"
